# Logistic-Regression
This project is my first project implementing a ML algorithm (Logistic Regression)

# Packages Required
1. ROCR
2. pROC
3. WVPlots
4. vtreat
5. ggplot2

# Flow
1. Data understanding 
2. Data type conversion
3. Feature Selection
4. Defining the model
5. Model training
6. Evaluation of the model

# Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy = 78.5%
2. sensitivity = 72.3%
3. specificity = 82.4%
4. Area under the curve= 0.8441
5. Relative Gini index = 0.69
